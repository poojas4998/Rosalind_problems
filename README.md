# Rosalind_problems
I am solving the problems from this website called Rosalind (https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/). Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

1. Counting DNA Nucleotides (DNA.ipynb) : https://rosalind.info/problems/dna/
2. Transcribing DNA into RNA (RNA.ipynb): https://rosalind.info/problems/rna/
3. Complementing a Strand of DNA (REVC.ipynb): https://rosalind.info/problems/revc/
